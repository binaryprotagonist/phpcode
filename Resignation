Dear Sir/Madam,

I regret to inform you that I am resigning from the position of PHP Software Developer due to personal reasons.

I appreciated my time spent working here and I have no ill-feelings towards this company or anyone who works here.

I would have provided the required notice if I were able to.
Thank you for this opportunity and if I am able to return to this company one day,
I hope that you will accept me back.

Please let me know if I can make this transition easier.
I will be available by phone or email a few weeks after my departure to help out.

Sincerely,
Shivam Yadav
Php Developer
Codemeg Soft Solution
